	The basic idea underlying the model proposed by Deneubourg et al. [TODO] is that isolated items should be picked up and dropped at some other location where more of the items of that type are present. 
	To first understand the clustering model, assume that there exists only one type of item. 
	Assume that the ants move randomly and at some time \(t\), an ant encounters an object.
	Let \(p_{pick}\) represent the probablity that the ant picks up this object.
	As per the assumption that this model makes, we would like this probability of picking up this object to be inversely proportional to the number of objects in its neighbourhood. 
	Let \(f\) represent a fraction of the total objects that reside in the neighbourhood of this object, and \(k_{pick}\) to be some constant. 
</p>
<p>
    $$p_{pick} = (\frac{k_{pick}}{k_{pick} + f})^2$$
</p>	
<p>
	when \(f \ll k_{pick}\), \(p_{pick} \sim 1\), and vice versa.
</p>
<p>
	To compute \(f\), Deneubourg et al. [TODO] assumed that each of the ants have a short term memory that records the number of objects enountered during a the last \(T\) timesteps. Let \(N\) represent this number. Assuming that at each timestep, at most 1 objects can be encountered, 
</p>
<p>
	$$f = N/T$$
